Conversational Goal Analysis: Instead of a static form, Disha AI engages you in a conversation, asking intelligent, clarifying questions to deeply understand your unique situation, skills, and ambitions.
Truly Personalized Roadmaps: The application generates a detailed plan that is tailored specifically to you. It considers your initial goal, your answers to the clarifying questions, and suggests steps that are relevant to your context.
Sleek, Modern UI: A beautiful, modern dark theme with interactive elements and smooth animations makes the process of planning your future an enjoyable and motivating experience.
Two-Step User Journey: A professional landing page introduces the features before guiding the user to the main application for a seamless experience.

**üöÄ How It Works**
The user journey is designed to be simple and intuitive:

Define Your Goal: After clicking "Get Started", the user is prompted to enter their primary, high-level goal.
AI-Powered Questions: The application sends this goal to the Gemini AI, which generates a set of 3-5 clarifying questions to gather more specific details.
Provide Context: The user answers these personalized questions.
Generate Roadmap: The initial goal and the user's answers are combined and sent back to the AI, which then crafts the final, detailed, multi-phase roadmap.

Frontend: Plain HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript (ES Modules).
Styling: Tailwind CSS for a utility-first styling workflow.
