## üöÄ How It Works  

The user journey is designed to be simple and intuitive:<br>  

1. **Landing Page**: The user is first greeted by a landing page that explains the core features of Disha AI.<br>  
2. **Define Your Goal**: After clicking *"Get Started"*, the user is prompted to enter their primary, high-level goal.<br>  
3. **AI-Powered Questions**: The application sends this goal to the Gemini AI, which generates a set of 3-5 clarifying questions to gather more specific details.<br>  
4. **Provide Context**: The user answers these personalized questions.<br>  
5. **Generate Roadmap**: The initial goal and the user's answers are combined and sent back to the AI, which then crafts the final, detailed, multi-phase roadmap.<br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
